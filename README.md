Slate is a low-level editor framework that helps you deal with difficult parts
when building an editor.

Taze Editor is built on top of Slate and heavily inspired by Plate. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

It provides a set of functions to help you build a rich text editor. It's a good
starting point for you to build your own customizable and extensible editor.

We are still in the early stage of development, so there are many things to
implement. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to
contribute.
