[Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) is a low-level editor framework
that helps you deal with difficult parts when building an editor.

Taze Editor is built on top of Slate and _heavily inspired by
[Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate)._ üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

It provides a set of functions to help you build a rich text editor. It's a good
starting point for you to build your own **customizable** and **extensible**
editor.

We are still in the early stage of development, so there are many things to
implement. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to
contribute.
